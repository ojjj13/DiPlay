# Experimental DiLink 4 cluster video

This optional route was tested on a 2022 BYD Seal with DiLink 4.0 / Android 10.
It keeps the main CarPlay stream on the head unit and launches a separate Activity
for the instrument-cluster stream. Other firmware has not been vehicle-tested.

## Setup

1. Enable the car's native cluster-map/projection mode.
2. In DiPlay settings, enable **DiLink 4 cluster video via ADB (experimental)**.
3. Tap **Authorize ADB / retry cluster routing** and approve the car's debugging
   prompt. Local ADB must be available; background retries never request approval.
4. Connect or reconnect the iPhone and open Apple Maps. The main CarPlay display
   stays on the head unit while the independent map appears on the cluster.

The route detects the current logical display ID from the exact XDJA-owned
`fission_bg_xdjaVirtualSurface` display at 1920×720. It does not assume display 1.
An absent, ambiguous or mismatched target is rejected. The Activity validates its
per-launch token and actual display before handing its surface to stream 111.
Some firmware reports display 0 to the view; in that case the exact Activity task
is checked in ADB's per-display Activity history.

A successful shell launch is not proof of visible output. Unconfirmed launches
retry after five seconds. Turning the feature off or destroying the host cancels
queued retries and invalidates launch tokens. Failed routing is recorded in the
normal diagnostic export. No stock task is moved and no OEM projection mode is
changed.

## Layout and navigation

The stream and texture buffer remain 1920×720 at 100% scale. The transparent,
non-focusable Activity leaves factory instruments visible. An inactive stream is
covered with black so a disconnected phone does not leave a frozen map behind.

**Cluster safe area · edit box** opens a fitted editor. Drag the green edges;
the outline is mirrored on the cluster during calibration. Save applies the new
safe area after reconnecting. Cancel keeps the saved mapping. The outline clears
on dismissal or leaving settings. The cluster mapping has its own preference and
does not overwrite the main display's mapping. Reset restores marker-offset-based
placement. A manual replug may still be needed after changing connection settings.

For this mode, an unset dashboard-content choice defaults to **Map with turn card**
(the phone's built-in card). Saved choices are preserved. **Map with custom turn
card** uses DiPlay's existing maneuver overlay, with live placement/size controls.
It reuses upstream’s info strip for phone-supplied arrival time, duration and
remaining distance. Missing totals stay blank. Guidance clears at route end/expiry/disconnect and hides with an inactive
stream. Map orientation is controlled by the phone's cluster stream.

## Scope and credit

DiLink 5/5.1 selection order and the upstream virtual-cluster fallback remain.
USB reconnection polling, colour controls and OEM song/L1 coordination are outside
this change. Automated tests cannot establish visible placement on other cars.

The direct `am start-activity --display … -f 0x18000000` approach follows the legacy
platform-21 implementation published by 寒叙 (@Hanxu4131):
